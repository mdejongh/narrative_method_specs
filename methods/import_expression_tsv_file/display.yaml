    <p>This uploader enables users to upload a gene expression data matrix in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format to your Narrative.</p><br>
    <p> Begin by selecting the ExpressionMatrix type in the dropdown (in Import tab) and click <i>Next</i>. Select the .tsv file for upload and click <i>Import</i>.</p><br>
    <p> The .tsv file is a tab delimited text file, with genes across the rows and sample/observations across the columns. Make sure the first label in the first column 
    is "gene-id" followed by tab delimited labels for samples. Each row (gene) should have an identifier (in green) that always goes in the first column. Each column 
    (sample) should have a label (in blue) that is always in the first row. The remaining cells in the table contain expression values for the appropriate gene and sample. 
    Be sure to exclude gene features with all missing expressions or non-changing expressions for all the conditions/samples.  See the 
    <a href="http://kbase.us/data-upload-download-guide/" target="_blank">Data Upload and Download Guide</a> for more informaiton about formatting your expression data file.</p>
